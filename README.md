# LSTM-Based Temperature Prediction Model

This repository contains the  code for a deep learning model designed to predict next-day average temperatures in London using historical weather data. The model uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a class of recurrent architectures well-suited for time series forecasting.

## Project Overview
The goal of this system is to forecast future temperature values by learning from past observations. It employs standard data preprocessing pipelines, a custom dataset loader and an LSTM architecture to model sequential patterns within daily temperature data.

## Key Components
### 1. Data Preparation
    Data Fetching: Historical weather data for London was collected via the Meteostat API. The focus was the daily average temperature.
    Data Normalization: All temperature values are scaled using MinMaxScaler to stabilize and enhance the learning process.
    Sequence Generation: Input-output pairs are generated by sliding a fixed-length window over the historical series, where each input sequence maps to the temperature of the following day.

### 2. Model Architecture
    LSTM Layers: The model consists of stacked LSTM layers capable of capturing temporal relationships and seasonal trends in the data.
    Dense Output Layer: A fully connected layer is used at the output to predict the scalar temperature value for the next day.

### 3. Pipeline Training
    Custom Dataset Class: Implemented using PyTorch to efficiently load and preprocess data sequences.
    DataLoader: Utilized to batch, shuffle, and parallelize data loading during training.
    Early Stopping and Monitoring: Training progress is tracked with validation loss to prevent overfitting.

### 4. Model Evaluation
    Visual Evaluation: Predicted vs actual temperature values are plotted to qualitatively assess model performance.
    Quantitative Metrics:
        Mean Squared Error (MSE)
        Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
        Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Results
The model effectively tracks temperature dynamics and capture temporary trends, especially during stable seasonal intervals. 
The performance metrics below have indicated consistent generalization capability of the model from training to testing.

#### Training Results (2015–2024)
  - Maximum Absolute Error: 8.63 °C
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.38 °C
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.77 °C

#### Testing Results (2024–2025)
  - Maximum Absolute Error: 6.76 °C
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.55 °C
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.96 °C

The lower Maximum Absolute Error during the testing period (6.76 °C) compared to the training period (8.63 °C) suggests that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Additionally, the MAE and RMSE remained within a narrow range across both periods, which is a proof of the model's stability and robustnes.
